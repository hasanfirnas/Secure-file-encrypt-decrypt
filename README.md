This Python project provides a user-friendly graphical interface for securely encrypting and decrypting files using the Fernet encryption scheme. Fernet is a symmetric key encryption method that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of your files.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Protect your sensitive files by encrypting them with a Fernet key.
- **Decryption:** Easily decrypt files using the same Fernet key that was used for encryption.
- **Key Generation:** Generate strong Fernet encryption keys with a single click.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive GUI for easy file encryption and decryption.
- **Log Management:** Keep track of your encryption and decryption activities with an integrated logging system.
